The most controversial statement in all of programming is <font face="Courier New">goto</font>. In Sxript, the place we actually "go-to" is called an <font face="Courier New">anchor</font>, which must appear in the same subprogram or codeblock as <font face="Courier New">goto</font>. An anchor is created by the <font face="Courier New">anchor_</font> statement, where the name of the anchor is to the right of the underscore. To jump to the anchor in a sub or block, use the <font face="Courier New">goto_</font> statement, where the anchor name follows the underscore.
