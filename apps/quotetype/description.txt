A <i>quote</i> is a string of characters that is not literally evaluated by the interpreter. Quotes are wrapped on the left by a backtick ( <font face="Courier New">`</font> ) and on the right by a single quote ( <font face="Courier New">'</font> ). (The double-quote sybmbol is not reserved.) Quotes can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided according the scheme illustrated below. <b>When printed to the console window, the wrapping symbols are ignored.</b>
